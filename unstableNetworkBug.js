The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the network connection is unstable or interrupted during critical operations like authentication or data synchronization. This can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes, especially in offline-first applications.  The error messages may not always be descriptive, and identifying the exact cause can be challenging without proper logging and error handling.
