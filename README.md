This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the Firebase SDK in environments with unreliable network connectivity. The `unstableNetworkBug.js` file showcases an application that attempts to perform operations that are vulnerable to network interruptions, such as authentication and data fetching. The application lacks proper error handling and logging, making it difficult to diagnose the underlying cause of errors. The `unstableNetworkSolution.js` provides an improved version with enhanced error handling, including retry mechanisms and offline capabilities.  Detailed instructions are provided in each file's comments.
